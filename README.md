The Discord message monitor is a self-bot tool to automatically gather and store messages in a convenient database. It's purpose is to work as a data-analysis tool so you can analyze any messages sent in any of your servers. It does NOT go through old messages (although that is planned, might still never make it), so it will only actively monitor newer messages, specifically the newest 50 messages will be grabbed on each channel check.
